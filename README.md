# Unity Neural Network Bird Project

Welcome to the Self-Learning Bird Project! This project aims to create an autonomous bird agent in a Unity environment using neural networks and evolutionary algorithms. The bird is equipped with distance sensors to detect obstacles and must learn to navigate through the environment to maximize its distance traveled.

## Features

- **Neural Network Implementation**: The bird's behavior is controlled by a neural network, allowing it to learn and adapt its movements based on sensory input.
- **Evolutionary Algorithm**: The project utilizes an evolutionary algorithm to train and evolve the neural network over multiple generations.
- **Unity Simulation**: The bird's learning process takes place within a Unity simulation environment, providing a realistic setting for training and evaluation.

## How It Works

1. **Initialization**: The project starts with a population of bird agents with randomly initialized neural networks.
2. **Simulation**: Each bird agent interacts with the Unity environment, using its neural network to make decisions based on sensor input.
3. **Evaluation**: The performance of each bird agent is evaluated based on its ability to navigate the environment and maximize distance traveled.
4. **Selection**: The best-performing bird agents are selected to produce offspring for the next generation using evolutionary principles such as mutation and crossover.
5. **Iteration**: Steps 2-4 are repeated for multiple generations, allowing the bird agents to progressively improve their navigation skills.

## Getting Started
